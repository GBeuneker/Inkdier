title: Red-Shanked Douc

---

Sometimes referred to as “the costumed ape,” the red-shanked douc is the most colorful of all primates! Maroon-red fur on the lower legs (shanks) leads one to think, imaginatively, that the primate may have slipped into a pair of colorful stockings. Likewise, the white fur extending the length of the monkey’s forearms is evocative of a pair of long gloves that perhaps this douc grabbed from a theatrical wardrobe. The eyelids appear to be dusted with a powder-blue eye shadow!

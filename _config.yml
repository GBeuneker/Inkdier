# Site settings

  I create and sell logos, cards, custom comic strips, and other illustrations. I have a great interest in creating, among other things, mythical-like animals and landscapes. I primarily make use of ink, watercolor paint and acrylic paint. I am currently creating illustrations for a children's book.
